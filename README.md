# FPGA Gateware Repo
This repo contains gateware/firmware that was developed for FPGA readout at ASU. VHDL is predominantly used for the synthesizable RTL and testbenches (using GHDL).

# Running GHDL TestBenches
 - [ ] link to GHDL
 - [ ] add GHDL howto instructions
 - [ ] run cocotb equivalent for test
