# FPGA Gateware Repo
This repo contains gateware/firmware that was developed for FPGA readout at ASU. VHDL is predominantly used for the synthesizable RTL and testbenches (using GHDL).

# In progress... ðŸš§ðŸ‘·ðŸš§

__TODO__ *before* hardware testing and merging branch to dev

## FPGA_GigabitTx VHDL
* test bench for data_buffer.vhd
* look at byte_data.vhd really hard
* instantiate pre_data_buffer.vhd in byte_data.vhd
* update data/control signals with spectrum data in byte_data.vhd
* look at byte_data.vhd really hard a little more

## Data Pipeline HDL
* test bench for pre_data_buffer.vhd
* test bench for n_bin_avg_wrapper.sv
* look where to smush IQ and make it so
